			<cite>This</cite></a> recipe has been serving me right since I moved from home. Not only is it a low number of ingredients, but the instructions themselves don't involve more
			than a little bit of effort.
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<p>The following ingredients makes two servings</p>
				<ul>
					<li>2 large russet potatoes</li>
					<li>1 cup prepared spinach artichoke</li>
					<li>1/2 cup shredded Irish cheddar cheese</1i>
				</ul>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F <i>(175 degrees C)</i>. 
					Pierce the potatoes in a couple of places with a sharp knife; place on a baking sheet.</li>
				<li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife easily slices through the potato, 45 to 60 minutes. 
					Cool potatoes for 10 minutes.</li>
				<li>Slice potatoes horizontally; scoop out the flesh with a fork, leaving the skin intact. 
					Mix potato flesh with spinach artichoke dip in a bowl; spoon back into the potato skins and top with Cheddar cheese.</1>
				<li>Bake in the oven until cheese is beginning to melt, 15 to 20 minutes. 
					Turn on oven's broiler and broil until cheese begin to bubble and brown, 2 to 5 minutes.</i> 
			</ol>
			<p>It is suggested you <strong>share</strong> the second potato. Don't be like me.</p>
